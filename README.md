I feel like it has happened many times in the past few years where I'll take out my phone and search on google for a "compound interest calculator" where I'll try to answer a question like: "How much money do I need to save to get (x) dollars in (y) years". The problem is that I always have to input an interest rate, details about compounding, variance, etc. which all have massive impacts on the calculation.

I decided to write this article to help me answer that question without having to make up some fake interest rate / variance that probably is not representative of reality. Take a look if you're interested :
